# 2D Character Action Game Prototype

Prototype based around combining concepts from highly mechanically complex but somewhat obtuse 2-D fighting games (i.e. Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, MUGEN engine) and accessible but at times overly simplistic platformers (i.e. Hollow Knight, Cuphead) to create a single-player experience that emphasizes and rewards dynamism and situational analysis.

Game objectives are:

Using a fighting game style combat engine to create a deep, interactive fighting system to:
* Reward awareness of movement and attack options
* Punish thoughtlessness in combat choices and disincentivize repetition 
* Subtly teach basic fighting game concepts like spacing, frame advantage/disadvantage, punishment through gameplay


While also taking advantage of the asymmetric, single-player aspect to:
* Provide a learning curve for the player, impossible in a symmetrical player-vs-player environment
* Give options for customization of character moveset
* Reward progression in game with new or improved attacks




Please note that this game will not compile, as sprites have not been included in the Github repo due to size/copyright constraints.
